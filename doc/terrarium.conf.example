[location]
# The latitude shoud be ca. the actual territory where the creatures
# live in the nature (but reflected into your hemisphere, if
# necessary, to get the seasons in sync).  The example (20.0) is
# roughly Ok for pogona henrylawsoni aka rankin's dragon, if you
# happen to live in the Northern hemisphere.  The longitude should be
# as close of your real location as possible, to get the noon of your
# terrarium in sync with your Sun.  Please use a GPS device or Google
# Map, and not your hat, to get the correct number and don't be afraid
# of long decimals.  Altitude is the actual altitude of the wild
# habitat, not your location.

# 'latitude' and 'longitude' in degrees, positive for east/north.
# 'altitude' in meters.  'timezone' should be the TZ of your location.
