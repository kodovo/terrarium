# terrarium

When using a Raspberry Pi for controlling the lights, heat, and
humidity of a terrarium, one needs some code.  Here is something which
hopes to evolve into a Python implementation of that.

Please copy doc/terrarium.conf.example to the runtime work directory
as terrarium.conf, and edit it if needed.
